  /api/v1/projects/applicants/status:
    put:
      summary: Update applicant status
      description: |
        Update the status of a project applicant (e.g., shortlisted, accepted, rejected).
        
        **Automatic Chat Creation**: When a developer is shortlisted or accepted (status = 'shortlisted' or 'accepted'), a direct conversation is automatically created between the project owner and the developer. The conversation is associated with the project for better organization and context.
        
        **Status Values**:
        - `applied` - Initial application status
        - `shortlisted` - Developer has been shortlisted (triggers automatic chat creation)
        - `interviewing` - Developer is in interview process
        - `accepted` - Developer has been accepted (triggers automatic chat creation)
        - `rejected` - Application has been rejected
        
        **Email Notifications**: Email notifications are sent when status changes to 'shortlisted' or 'rejected'.
        
        **Note**: Chat creation is non-blocking - if chat creation fails, the status update still succeeds.
